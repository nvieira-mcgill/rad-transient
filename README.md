# rad-transient
Basic Monte Carlo code for simulating a radioactively-powered astrophysical transient such as a supernova or kilonova. The only radiative processes considered are electron scattering and bound-bound interactions. Written for McGill course PHYS642 - Radiative Processes in Astrophysics. The methods used are based primarily on the work of:

* Bulla 2019, MNRAS 489, 5037-5045 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.489.5037B/abstract
* Bulla et al. 2015, MNRAS 450, 967â€“981
* Kasen et al. 2006, ApJ 651, 366-380
